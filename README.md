##Overview
This task management system is designed to allow administrators to create, update, and delete tasks, while managers can manage and assign tasks to developers. Users have the ability to adjust task states. The system utilizes JWT authentication for security, a service-oriented architecture for efficient control, and Carbon for handling time formats.

Backend: [Laravel]
Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT)
Time Handling: Carbon
Database: [MySQL]

##User Roles and Permissions
Administrator:
Create, update, and delete tasks
Manage user accounts
Manager:
Manage tasks
Assign tasks to developers
User:
Adjust task states

##Authentication
JWT tokens are used to authenticate users.
Tokens are generated upon successful login and included in subsequent requests.
Token validation is performed on the server side.
##Task Management
Tasks have the following properties:
ID
Title
Description
Due date
Priority
Status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed)
Administrators can create, update, and delete tasks.
Managers can assign tasks to developers and update task statuses.
Users can update task statuses.
##Time Handling
Carbon is used for handling time-related operations.
Time formats can be customized using Carbon's methods.
##Security
JWT authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
Input validation is performed to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Regular security updates and best practices are followed.
Deployment Steps:

Choose a Deployment Environment:

Localhost: For development and testing.
Cloud Platform: AWS, GCP, Azure, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc., for production.
Prepare Your Laravel Application:

Ensure Up-to-Date: Make sure your Laravel application is using the latest stable version.
Configure Environment Variables: Set environment variables like APP_URL, DB_CONNECTION, JWT_SECRET, etc., in your .env file.
Optimize for Production: Use production-ready configurations, disable debugging, and consider caching mechanisms.
Install Dependencies:

Use composer install --no-dev to install production dependencies.
Configure Web Server:

Apache: Set up a virtual host and configure document root.
Nginx: Create a server block and configure location.
Cloud Platform: Follow specific instructions for your chosen platform.
Set Up Database:

Create the necessary database and user.
Configure database credentials in your .env file.
Run migrations using php artisan migrate.
Deploy the Application:

FTP/SFTP: Upload the entire project directory to your server.
Git: Push your project to a remote repository and deploy from there (e.g., using a deployment tool).
Cloud Platform: Use their specific deployment tools or CLI commands.
Configure JWT Authentication:

Generate Secret Key: Create a strong random secret key and store it securely.
Configure Middleware: Add the auth:api middleware to routes that require authentication.
Issue Tokens: Use Auth::guard('api')->attempt() to authenticate users and issue tokens.
Verify Tokens: Use Auth::guard('api')->validate() to verify tokens in subsequent requests.
